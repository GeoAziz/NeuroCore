# **App Name**: NeuroCore

## Core Features:

- Patient Dashboard: Patient Neural Dashboard to visualize cognition score, mood tracker, therapy sessions, and a 3D brain model highlighting areas of stress and anxiety.
- Doctor Interface: Doctor Interface to view patient mind maps, waveform feeds, session logs, and AI-generated summaries for quick diagnostics and treatment planning.
- Therapy Center: Therapy and Simulations Center offering virtual relaxation spaces, cognitive puzzle games, and AI-simulated dream environments to aid in patient wellness.
- Privacy Console: Privacy Console with 'MindLock' mode, therapy mode toggle, and mental record manager for secure data handling and user control.
- Analytics & AI Reports: Analytics and Trends reporting for emotional heatmaps, pattern detections, and sleep cycle tracking integrated with user journal feedback, highlighting insights provided as tool by the system’s AI.
- Admin Console: Admin Console to oversee doctor access logs, manage therapy content, review anomaly reports, and maintain the MediChain record bridge.

## Style Guidelines:

- The overall goal will be calm tones, making complex neuro data feel understandable and human. Therefore we will use a dark color scheme.
- Primary color: A subdued purple (#9467d4) to reflect intellect and introspection.
- Background color: A dark desaturated purple (#2e2539).
- Accent color: A vivid pink (#d467b1), 30 degrees 'left' of purple, to highlight key interactions and real-time indicators such as live case alerts or neural activity meters.
- Headline font: 'Space Grotesk' (sans-serif) for a futuristic feel.
- Body font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a modern, objective look.
- Use minimalist icons representing different brain functions, mental states, and data visualizations.
- Emphasize split-view UIs and interactive 3D models within dedicated layout sections. Maintain calming balance between data and immersive graphics, and emotion-aware UI elements such as heatmaps.
- Incorporate subtle, calming animations that visualize data flow within the 3D neural network and therapy simulations.
